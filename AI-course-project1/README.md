to do:

1. Modify codes into ours

2. ’Linear' and visualize the decision boundary learned by your model.

3. ’NonLinear' and visualize the decision boundary learned by your model.

4. learning rate / plots illustrating the total cost of your model over time for different settings of the learning rate.

5. number of nodes in the hidden layer / plots showing the decision boundaries learned by your model for different settings of the number of nodes in the hidden layer

6. classify digits using the files X_train and y_train. Evaluate the classifier performance on the test set (X_test) by computing the average classification accuracy along with a confusion matrix. Compare the performance of your neural network classifier with your logistic regression classifier.
